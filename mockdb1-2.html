                    <p><u>This piece is all about database creation and the tables within.</u></p>
                    <p><u>Let's get to work!</u></p>

                    <img src="./images/mockdb/mockdb1-2.PNG" alt="Database Diagramming">

                    <p>In the first part of the video, Adam talks about using a database diagramming service known as Quick DBD or Database Diagramms. The software is not only easy to use but it has great features such as the ability to define tables and their content using plain text as well as the ability to export a visual of the schema and export queries (In the syntax of your database solution) that you can use to create your tables.</p>
                    <p>I used excel to simulate how the columns and rows would be laid out as well as import my mock data to make it easy to populate the tables on SQL server.</p>

                    <img src="./images/mockdb/mockdb1-21.PNG" alt="Visual Studio Code w/ SQL Query">

                    <p>I exported the queries from Quick DBD and opened it in Visual Studio Code to give it a quick QA and once over before exicuting on Sql Server.</p>

                    <img src="./images/mockdb/mockdb1-22.PNG" alt="Microsft SQL Server Management Studio">

                    <p>Once ready, I pasted the queries into SSMS and executed. After a quick refresh of the database I was able to see that the tables populated.</p>

            
                    <img src="./images/mockdb/mockdb1-23.PNG" alt="Excelsior">

                    <p>The next thing I had to do was copy over the data from my excel sheet. In order to do this I copy the data from excel, navigated to the object explorer pane in SSMS, expand the directory until I found my newly created tables, right click on the table, and select edit top 200 rows. From there, I left clicked on the asterisk to highlight the row and then right clicked to paste.</p>
